 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 *
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 *
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

/* Task 1: `counterMaker`
 * Study the code for counter1 and counter2. Answer the questions below.
 *
 * 1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
 *
 * the variable count is within the function scope in counter 1, and outside of the function scope in counter 2.
 *
 * 2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
 *
 * Counter1 has closure because it has a function, within a function. Although you can also say that conter2 also has closure since all javascript functions have closure.
 *
 * 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better?
 *
 * If we are using the variable count later in code, we would not want to to have a functional scope and would want to use counter2. counter1 would be useful when you are counting continuous strings of data.

/* Task 2: inning()

Write a higher order function called `finalScore` that accepts the callback function `inning` (from above) and a number of innings and and returns the final score of the game in the form of an object.

For example,

Create a function called `scoreboard` that accepts the following parameters:
